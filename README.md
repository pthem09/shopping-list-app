# Shopping List App

Hosting link: https://pthem09.github.io/shopping-list-app

## Project overview

- Developed by Paul Them, 2024

- The website allows users to enter a wishlist. Entries are stored in a public SQL database and are visible by anyone and accessible from any machine.

  - When many items are added to the list, it may become cumbersome to scroll through. Additional functionality allows users to select the number of items displayed on the screen.
  - Dropdown menus appear as needed to allow users to go to the next or previous page, or jump to a specific page.
  - The current displayed page will change as items are added and deleted, as necessary.

- Technologies used:

    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - SQL (CodeSandbox)
    - Express.js
    - Node.js
- Ideas for improvements:
 1. Create a log-in page to allow users to view and edit only their items.
 2. Allow users to view and restore recently deleted items by creating a deleted flag in the SQL database. Also, allow for users to permanently delete items from the recycle bin.
 3. Allow users to select dark mode and different color schemes.
